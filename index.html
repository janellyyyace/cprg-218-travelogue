        <h1>Janel in Japan</h1>
        <p>Hi! I went to Japan with my family back in 2023. We traveled from Osaka to Tokyo. Here's some of our highlights!</p>

            <h2>Universal Studios Japan</h2>
            <p>Universal Studios Japan brings a plethora of your favorite fictional fantasies to life! From the cretaceous creations of Jurassic Park, the wizarding world of Harry Potter, and the numerous Nintendo attractions, the park has something for anyone and everyone from a childhood decades ago to a childhood happening now. With all that said, there are a LOT of people that visit these parks. If you do decide to go, I would suggest having a plan, having some water, and having a limit on your wallet, so you don’t lose it all at the gift shop.

            <img src="/images/Osaka Castle.JPG" alt="This is a low-angle picture of a curly-haired Filipino teenager in front of the Osaka Castle." title="This is my brother. He wanted me to take this picture.">
            <h2>Osaka Castle</h2>
            <p>What was once home to 400,000 inhabitants including the Tokugawa shogunate now sees annual visitors upwards of 2.5 million people including me and my family! In addition to being a living historical monument, the area around offers a great location for strolls and photos. Speaking of thousands of inhabitants and historical monuments, the indoor museum offers quite a few of both, but the latter tends to make up for the crowd somewhat.

            <img src="images/Banaria Family_Tokyo Tower.JPG" alt="This is a picture of a Filipino family with a miniature version of the Tokyo Tower taken at the highest floor of the Tokyo Tower." alt="The glass floor section was terrifying.">
            <h2>Tokyo Tower</h2>
            <p>Since the dawn of time humanity has always had a fascination with making really really tall buildings and Tokyo Tower is one of them! Standing at 332.9 m a full ⅓ of a kilometer, it’s breathtaking, it’s a marvel, and it’s downright terrifying! The inside also has a few places offering some very delicious food albeit fairly expensive. Last but not least, the view and the photos you can get from it are breathtaking provided you can stomach looking down.
